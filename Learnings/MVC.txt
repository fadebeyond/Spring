In summary, the Model represents the data and business logic of the application,
while the View is responsible for presenting the application's user interface.
Together with the Controller, which handles user input and orchestrates the interaction between the Model and View,
they form the core components of the MVC pattern in Spring.
This separation of concerns allows for modular and maintainable web application development.

In addition to understanding the basic concepts of Model, View, and Controller (MVC) in the context of Spring Boot,
There are a few additional points to know:

Annotations: Spring Boot makes extensive use of annotations to simplify the configuration of MVC components.
 For example, @Controller is used to indicate that a class serves as a controller, @RequestMapping is used to map HTTP requests to specific handler methods, and @ModelAttribute is used to bind request parameters to model attributes.

Component Scanning: Spring Boot automatically scans for components such as controllers, services, and repositories within the application package and its sub-packages.
This eliminates the need for explicit configuration and makes it easier to develop and maintain the application.

Template Engines: While Spring Boot supports various template engines for building views, such as Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and JSP,
it recommends the use of Thymeleaf due to its powerful features and seamless integration with Spring Boot.

Auto-Configuration: Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for MVC components, which means that default configurations are applied automatically based on the dependencies present in the project.
This reduces the need for manual configuration and allows developers to focus on writing business logic.

RESTful Services: In addition to traditional web applications, Spring Boot also facilitates the development of RESTful web services using the same MVC architecture.
Controllers can be annotated with @RestController to indicate that they are responsible for handling RESTful requests, and data can be serialized and deserialized using built-in support for JSON and XML.

Testing: Spring Boot provides robust support for testing MVC components, including controllers, views, and RESTful services.
This allows developers to write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of their applications.
